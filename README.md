*Scaffold out a TestCafe reporter*

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/DevExpress/generator-testcafe-reporter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DevExpress/generator-testcafe-reporter)

TestCafe can build test run reports in your own format and style. What you have to do is create a custom reporter plugin.
This Yeoman generator scaffolds out such a plugin, so that you only need to write a few lines of code.
